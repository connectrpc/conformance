  # Don't overwrite release notes. The process is to create the release manually in
  # the GitHub UI, curating the release notes by editing the auto-generated notes.
  # A GitHub action will then act when the tag is created and run goreleaser to
  # generate the release artifacts and upload them and attach them to the release.
