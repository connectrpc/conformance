`connect-crosstest` runs a suite of cross-compatibility tests using every combination of the
following clients and servers:

### Servers

- Connect, using [Connect's Go implementation][connect-go]
- gRPC, using [grpc-go][grpc-go]

### Clients

- Connect, using [Connect's Go implementation][connect-go]
- gRPC, using [grpc-go][grpc-go]
- [connect-web][connect-web]
- [grpc-web][grpc-web]

The test suite is run daily against the latest commits of [connect-go][connect-go], [connect-web][connect-web] 
and [protobuf-es][protobuf-es] to ensure that we are continuously testing for compatibility.

For more on Connect, see the [announcement blog post][blog], the documentation
on [connect.build][docs] (especially the [Getting Started] guide for Go), or
the [demo service][demo].

## Test Suite

The test suite is a superset of [gRPC][grpc-interop] and [grpc-web][grpc-web-interop] interop
tests. Clients and servers use the [gRPC interop Protobuf definitions][test.proto] and cover
a range of expected behaviours and functionality for gRPC and Connect.

### Test Descriptions

#### empty_unary

RPC: `EmptyCall`

Client calls `EmptyCall` with an `Empty` request and expects no errors and an empty response.

#### large_unary

RPC: `UnaryCall`

Client calls `UnaryCall` with a payload size of 250 KiB bytes and expects a response with a
payload size of 500 KiB and no errors.

#### client_streaming

RPC: `StreamingInputCall`

Client calls `StreamingInputCall` then sends 4 requests with a payload size of 250 KiB,
8 bytes, 1 KiB, and 32 KiB and expects the aggregated payload size to be 289800 bytes when
the client closes the stream and no errors.

#### server_streaming

RPC: `StreamingOutputCall`

Client calls `StreamingOutputCall` and receives exactly 4 times, expecting responses with
a payload size of 250 KiB, 8 bytes, 1 KiB, and 32 KiB, and no errors.

#### ping_pong

RPC: `FullDuplexCall`

Client calls `FullDuplexCall` exactly 4 times with a request with a payload of 250 KiB
and receives a response with a payload of 500 KiB, a request with a payload of 8 bytes
and receives a response with a payload of 16 bytes, a request with a payload of 1 KiB
and receives a response with a payload of 2 KiB, and a request with a payload of 32 KiB
and receives a response with a payload of 64 kiB. Client asserts that payload sizes
are in order and then closes the stream. No errors are expected.

#### empty_stream

RPC: `FullDuplexCall`/`StreamingOutputCall`

Client calls `FullDuplexCall` (web client calls `StreamingOutputCall`) and then closes. No
response or errors are expected.

#### fail_unary

RPC: `FailUnary`

Client calls `FailUnary` which always responds with an error with status `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`
and a non-ASCII message with error details.

#### fail_server_streaming

RPC: `FailStreamingOutputCall`

Client calls `FailStreamingOutputCall` which always responds with an error with status `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`
and a non-ASCII message with error details.

#### cancel_after_begin

RPC: `StreamingInputCall`

Client calls `StreamingInputCall`, cancels the context, then closes the stream, and expects
an error with the code `CANCELED`.

#### cancel_after_first_response

RPC: `FullDuplexCall`

Client calls `FullDuplexCall`, receives a response, then cancels the context, then closes
the stream, and expects an error with the code `CANCELED`.

#### timeout_on_sleeping_server

RPC: `FullDuplexCall`/`StreamingOutputCall`

Client calls `FullDuplexCall` (web client calls `StreamingOutputCall`) with a timeout, closes
the stream and expects to receive an error with status `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`.

#### custom_metadata

RPC: `UnaryCall`, `StreamingOutputCall`, `FullDuplexCall`

Client calls `UnaryCall` with a request with a custom header and custom binary trailer attached
and expects the same metadata to be attached to the response. Client calls `StreamingOutputCall`
with a request with a custom header and custom binary trailer and expects the same metadata
to be attached to the response when stream is closed. Client calls `FullDuplexCall`
with a request with a custom header and custom binary trailer and expects the same metadata
to be attached to the response when stream is closed. The `web` flows only test the unary and 
server streaming RPC.

#### duplicated_custom_metadata

RPC: `UnaryCall`, `StreamingOutputCall`, `FullDuplexCall`

This is the same as the `custom_metadata` test but uses metadata values that have `,` separators
to test header and trailer behaviour.

#### status_code_and_message

RPC: `UnaryCall`, `FullDuplexCall`

Client calls `UnaryCall` with a request containing a `code` and `message` and expects an error
with the provided status `code` and `message`in response. Client calls `FullDuplexCall` with
a request containing a `code` and `message`, closes the stream, and expects to receive an
error with the provided status `code`and `message`. The `web` flows only test the unary RPC.

#### special_status_message

RPC: `UnaryCall`

Client calls `UnaryCall` with a request containing a `code` and `message` with whitespace
characters and Unicode and expects an error with the provided status `code` and `message`
in response.

#### unimplemented_method

RPC: N/A

Client calls `UnimplementedCall` with an empty request and expects an error with the status
`UNIMPLEMENTED`.

#### unimplemented_server_streaming_method

RPC: N/A

Client calls `UnimplementedStreamingOutputCall` with an empty request and expects an error with the status
`UNIMPLEMENTED`.

#### unimplemented_service

RPC: N/A

Client calls an unimplemented service and expects an error with the status `UNIMPLEMENTED`.

#### unimplemented_server_streaming_service

RPC: N/A

Client calls `UnimplementedStreamingOutputCall` to an unimplemented service with an empty request and expects
an error with the status `UNIMPLEMENTED`.

#### unresolvable_host

RPC: N/A

Client calls an unresolvable host and expects an error with the status `UNAVAILABLE`.

## Requirements and Running the Tests

### Github Actions

There are Github Actions workflows for [go][github-action-go] and [web][github-action-web] configured for running the daily crosstest against 
the latest commits of [connect-go][connect-go], [connect-web][connect-web] and [protobuf-es][protobuf-es].

### Locally

To run these locally tests, you'll need Docker. The test suite uses Docker Compose.
Please note, that if you are running the tests on MacOS, you'll need to [enable Docker
Compose V2][docker-compose-v2]. In short, Docker Desktop -> Preferences -> General -> Use Docker
Compose V2, then click Apply & Restart.

You can run the tests using `make dockercomposetest`.

## Support and Versioning

`connect-crosstest` works with:

* The most recent release of Go.

Unlike Connect's Go implementation, `connect-crosstest` has no exported APIs
and makes no backward compatibility guarantees. We'd like to release it as an
interoperability testing toolkit eventually, but don't have a concrete timeline
in mind.
