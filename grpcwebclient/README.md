# gRPC-web conformance client

This directory contains a conformance client built with the [gRPC-web](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web) library. Its
purpose is to corroborate testing results with Connect clients and servers using the gRPC-web protocol.

It is run against both the Connect reference server and the gRPC-Go reference server during conformance tests.
