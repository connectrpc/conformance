# Connect Conformance

A test suite for [Connect](https://connectrpc.com) that verifies cross-platform conformance for
both clients and servers.

## Summary

The Connect conformance test suite is a series of tests that are run using a client and server to validate interoperability,
compatibility, and conformance across the Connect, gRPC, and gRPC-Web protocols. The test suite is meant to exercise
various scenarios with a client-server interaction to ensure the results are as expected across platforms.
