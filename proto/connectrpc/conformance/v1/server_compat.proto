// done by using port zero (0) when creating a network listener
// so that the OS selects an available ephemeral port.
//
// These properties are read from stdin. Once the server is
// listening, details about the server, in the form of a
// ServerCompatResponse, are written to stdout.

// When testing multiple configurations, multiple test processes
// will be started, each with different properties.
