# These return 400 instead of 405 and 415. This is an inconsistency in grpc-go
# between using its builtin HTTP/2 implementation vs. using net/http. So the
#  normal grpc protocol works (using the former); it's just grpc-web that does not.
# These will be fixed in the next release of grpc-go:
#    https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/pull/6989

Server Unexpected Requests/HTTPVersion:1/**/unexpected content type

 # The entries for "cardinality violation" in the following doc indicate that
 # these cases should fail with "unimplemented":
 #   https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_statuscodes.html
 # But the grpc-go client instead fails with "unknown".
