# The gRPC-web client only supports true server streaming when using mode=grpcwebtext, which Connect doesn't
# support. Server streaming is still possible but all responses are buffered and delivered at the same time so
# we can't test cancellations after responses. In addition, even cancelling before receiving responses doesn't
# throw any sort of error, so we can't correctly verify a stream was canceled.

# There is a bug in the gRPC-web client with handling duplicate trailer metadata for responses where trailers
# are encoded in the body, which are parsed using this code:
#   https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web/blob/83eec72cc3b6bb4c6d152ace7e246d98b808dd85/javascript/net/grpc/web/grpcwebclientreadablestream.js#L367
# And since that uses an object keyed to trailer name, it will eliminate dupes. Responses that use a
# "trailers only" response can succeed, however, because those trailers are actually encoded as HTTP
# headers, which are not parsed with the above code.

# The gRPC-Web client does not appear to actually implement the HTTP to gRPC status code
# mapping described in this part of the spec:
#   https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/http-grpc-status-mapping.md
# Instead, it always returns an "unknown" code if the response does not include a
# grpc-status header/trailer key.
