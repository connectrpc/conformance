# Currently, connect-go returns an "internal" error when either of these occurs.
# However, the gRPC specs state that a problem with message cardinality (where
# a single message is expected but stream actually has a different number), in
# both clients and servers, should be an "unimplemented" error.

# Search for "cardinality violation" in this doc:
